# IMDb_Data_Analysis
## Description:
Certainly! In my project, I performed an in-depth data analysis on an IMDb dataset using Excel. I explored various aspects such as top countries by the number of titles, genre-based revenue insights, the movie with the highest revenue, total sequels in the dataset, top 5 profitable movies, highest IMDb-rated films, color vs. black-and-white movies, and the year that produced the maximum number of films. This analysis provided valuable insights into the dataset's trends and cinematic landscape.

## This Project involves the following steps :
- Data Understanding 
- Data Cleaning
- Data Manipulating
- Explotory data analysis(EDA)
- Data visualization by Dashboard & insights

## This project also gave important answers to questions like :
1. What are the top 10 countries with most titles?
2. Which genre generated highest and lowest revenue?
3. Which year produced maximum no of movies?
4. What are the total no of sequal released in the dataset and which made maximum revenue?
5. Top 5 profitable movies?
6. Highest IMDb rated movies?
7. Number of colour and black & white movies?

## Based on my Report Insights , here are the outcomes:-
1. USA has most number titles with 2944 titles followed by UK-304 and France-104:


2. "Action" generated highest revenue of total $67,540,890,818 and Thriller generated lowest revenue of only $121,539.
